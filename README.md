Hi there, and welcome to Beepo. - version 1.

https://beepo.netlify.app/

This is a basic online synthesizer, designed to be used with Playtronica's Playtron device. Just plug one in, plug in a banana or 16 to the device, load up the application, and go wild. There is a drum loop, which you can activate by hitting the button in the top right corner.

This should also work with any midi device between the notes of C1 and D#2, although I do not have the means to test this.

Beepo was built using the create-react-app, howler, use-sound, and framer-motion.

What to look out for in version 2 -

- Code refactoring!
- Multiple drum loops to choose from
- Multiple sound libraries to choose from
- Customizable sound setups
- iPad/tablet friendly version triggered by touch, for those without a Playtron or Midi device.

Possible features for version 3 -

- Built in record and loop function
- More visuals
- Upload your own sounds
- Mobile friendly version (most likely with less sound triggers)

Any requests or suggestions, feel free to send through a pull request, or drop me a message. I'm also up for collaborations.

Much love - Tom.
